# ShadCN Component Installation
Install components via: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`
1. Full list can be found [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion).
2. ShadCN provides components via their source files; it does not bundle them all together by default as in a traditional component library. This means that you should install individual components rather than an entire component library.
3. This also means we have full access to the source code and so modifying them is encouraged.

Components are stored in `src/components/ui`  
Styles are stored `src/app/globals.css`  
Component test page  can be found at `localhost:3000/dev`
